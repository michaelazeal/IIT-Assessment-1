  <h2>About me</h2> 
  <p>My name is Michaela, I currently live in the beautiful Glasshouse Mountains on the Sunshine Coast with my partner & son. I worked in the head office of Flight Centre for 10+ 
      years with my last role being a National Product Leader for Flight Centre Business Travel.
    <br><br>
    I have always been interested in some form of IT from a young age. I've always found new programs and systems easy to pick up and have the mentality that if I don't know the 
    answer, I can usually find it on the internet!
    After 10 years in the travel industry, I was getting bored and looking for a new career path. I was drawn to website design as I could see the need for small businesses to have modern
    websites and with my years in a corporate product and marketing role I had a headstart on knowing what makes a good website content wise. It wasn’t until I began the show ‘Zoey’s 
    Extraordinary Playlist’ that I saw women in engineering management roles that I actually considered getting on the other side of websites and looking into programming and coding.
    <br><br>
    I have very limited experience with any coding but been creating websites on Squarespace and Wix and dabbling with a little CSS as i've gone along.
    <br><br>
    I'm excited to be part of RMIT as it is one of the top schools in the country for tecnology, has a great reputation and offers the couse that I wanted. I am excited to graduate
    with a really solid skillset to set up be for a great career in IT.

<p>In my previous role, we used the Myers Briggs personality test many times over the course of years of training days and I have always had the same outcome. The INFP or 
  'Mediator' personality type.
  <br>
  I am extremely empathetic, which is valued in teams however can be taken advantage of with the wrong personalisty types.
  I have learnt over the years that setting boundaries with colleagues and members of my team is something I find challenging and I have a tendancy to take on too many tasks
  that are part of anothers work load. 
  <br>
  It is important for me to work in a team where everyone feels valued and is heard. Whilst I am an energetic, bubbly person I don't enjoy working in teams with 
  loud and domineering personalities.

  <h2>Project Idea</h2>  

          
          <h4>Mobile Application - Horse Quiz</h4>

          <p>The project I would like to work on is an app for Pony Clubs and Horse Riding Schools which teaches riders the information required to sit their Equestrian Australia Certifications. 
            It would would be a educational app similar to the ‘mimo’ coding quiz app.
          <br>
          <p>The application would have both a educational component with different levels to complete before a quiz was presented to the user.
            Each stage would follow the protocols set out by Equestrian Australia regarding their minimum level of knowledge required to sit each Certificate.
          <br>
          The application would have two components, the learning portion with levels to complete and the quizzes.
          <br><br>
          Learning levels
          <br>
          The learning levels would be made up of chapters of educational materials teaching the user about a specific component of horse husbandry, riding or general information.
          <br><br>
          Quiz
          <br>
          The application would hold thousands of quiz questions and answers that have been grouped into levels for users to complete as they go through the learning content.
          <br>
          The user would be able to join groups, such as be in teams with members from their pony club and be able to see the results of others in their region to foster friendly competition.
